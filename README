https://github.com/jwinky/eqemu_char_import

A system for automatically levelling and re-equipping characters based on data from the EQ Client /outputfile command.

Features:
  * only works on level 1 characters
  * imports inventory, bank (including shared bank), and spellbook
  * enforces race, class, and deity restrictions
  * uses a database table to queue and track import requests
  * designed to be invoked periodically from cron (or another scheduler)
  * can optionally restrict allowed items with a whitelist (TBD)

Installation:

1. Install Ruby (version 2.1-2.5 recommended)

2. Install the 'mysql2' rubygem

3. Edit dbconfig.yml to specify your database settings.

   The 'import_script_db' database is used for internal script tables.  The scripts in the sql/
   directory must be loaded into this database.  You can use your EQEmu database for this, but
   we recommend a separate database.

   The 'eqemu_db' database connects to your actual EQEmu database.  The script will update
   character data in this database.

4. Edit the eqemu_char_import.rb script and review the configuration settings near the top

5. (DIY) Create import requests (in the 'requests' database table)

   Unfortunately, you have to figure this out yourself.  You could have people submit requests
   via email, from a website, by tweet, or via Discord bot.  Providing solutions for all possible
   mechanisms is beyond the scope of this project.

Usage:

To use, just run the script.  Errors will produce (hopefully helpful) output.  On success,
the script outputs nothing and exits with status 0.

Any error will result in a non-0 exit status.  The actual exit status is meaningful and can
help you figure out exactly where in the code the error occurs.

Future Improvements:

  * support on-demand usage as well as scheduled
  * process a single request by ID and exit
  * get request status
